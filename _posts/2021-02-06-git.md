Git is an open-source version control system, which supports your development tasks,
especially in distributed code projects.

## Installation

Git can be easily installed on Linux systems with the available package managers.
E.g. for Debian-based systems by `apt install git`.

For other systems, see the download page of Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Using Git

### Basic workflow

Clone repository

```shell
git clone https://https://github.com/<USER>/<REPOSITORY>.git ./repo

cd repo
```

Make some changes and push them to GitHub

```shell
git add .

git commit -m "my_commit"

git push
```

After smo more changes to a local files you need to upload them to GitHub

```shell
git pull

git commit -m "my_second_commit"

git push
```

The following commands can help work with `git`.

### Working with git-flow

Git-flow assists you by combining multiple steps of `git` commands into one `git-flow` command
which will do a workflow of steps. Although `git-flow` makes life easier in some cases,
it makes it also more complex sometimes and you need to execute some steps before or after using
a `git-flow` command as regular `git` command. (See below)

As an example, here is the comparison between the regular `git` commands and the appropriate
the committed `git-flow` command for creating a release.

| git-flow command                                    | git command                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `git-flow feature start <feature_name>`             | `git checkout -b feature/<feature_name> develop`      |
| `git-flow feature finish <feature_name> [--squash]` | `git checkout develop`                                |
|                                                     | `git merge [--squash] --no-ff feature/<feature_name>` |
|                                                     | `git branch -d feature/<feature_name>`                |

Another `git-flow` cheat sheet can be found [here](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/).

## GitHub Users

### Your first time with git and github

If you’ve never used git or github before, there are a bunch of things that you need to do. It’s [very well explained on github](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git), but repeated here for completeness.

-   Get a [github](https://github.com) account.
-   Download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
-   Set up git with your user name and email.
    
    -   Open a terminal/shell and type:
        
        ```shell
        git config --global user.name "Your name here"
        git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
        ```
             
        I also do:
        
        ```shell
        git config --global color.ui true
        git config --global core.editor emacs
        ```
        
        The first of these will enable colored output in the terminal; the second tells git that you want to use emacs.
        
-   Set up ssh on your computer. Also see [github’s guide to generating SSH keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys).
    
    -   Look to see if you have files `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.
    -   If not, create such public/private keys: Open a terminal/shell and type:
        
        ```shell
        ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
        ```
        
    -   Copy your public key (the contents of the newly-created `id_rsa.pub` file) into your clipboard. **On a Mac**, in the terminal/shell, type:
        
        ```shell
        pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        ```
        
-   Paste your ssh public key into your github account settings.
    
    -   Go to your github [Account Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile)
    -   Click “[SSH Keys](https://github.com/settings/ssh)” on the left.
    -   Click “Add SSH Key” on the right.
    -   Add a label (like “My laptop”) and paste the public key into the big text box.
    -   In a terminal/shell, type the following to test it:
        
        ```shell
        ssh -T git@github.com
        ```
        
    -   If it says something like the following, it worked:
        
        ```shell
        Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but Github does
        not provide shell access.
        ```

### The Silver Bullet

Want Just Works™? This is the magic silver bullet.

Get your access token (see the section in the cheat sheet if you need the GitHub or [Gitea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gitea) instructions for that) and set it in an environment variable (both for local development and deployment):

```shell
MY_GIT_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

For GitHub, copy and run these lines _verbatim_:

```shell
git config --global url."https://api:$MY_GIT_TOKEN@github.com/".insteadOf "https://github.com/"
git config --global url."https://ssh:$MY_GIT_TOKEN@github.com/".insteadOf "ssh://git@github.com/"
git config --global url."https://git:$MY_GIT_TOKEN@github.com/".insteadOf "git@github.com:"
```

Congratulations. Now any automated tool cloning Git repositories won't be obstructed by a password prompt, whether using HTTPS or either style of an SSH URL.

**Not using GitHub?**

For other platforms (Gitea, GitHub, and [Bitbucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitbucket)), just change the URL. Don't change the usernames (although arbitrary, they're needed for distinct configuration entries).

**Compatibility**

This works locally in macOS, Linux, Windows (in Bash), Docker, [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/about/), Heroku, [Akkeris](https://beta.akkeris.io/features.html), etc.

**More information**

See the ".gitconfig insteadOf" section of the cheat sheet.

**Security**

See the "Security" section of the cheat sheet.

## Using git-crypt

Having secret or sensitive information in your git repository is never a good choice. But
sometimes it's necessary. Never push unencrypted data to your remote repository.

Git-crypt is a transparent encryption tool that works seamlessly with your Git repository. All sensitive
information is encrypted before being pushed to the remote repository. Once you've unlocked the
repository locally, all data will be decrypted automatically when pulled from the remote
repo. This makes development with encrypted data effortless.

To install git-crypt, you can use your package manager of choice (e.g. `apt`):

```shell
sudo apt install git-crypt
```

To initialize a new repository with git-crypt, you can use `git-crypt init` when located in the
repository directory. An already encrypted git repository can be unlocked by `git-crypt unlock`.
This requires you to have either the repository encryption key in your GPG keychain or that
your private GPG key has been added to the allowed keys in the repository. For more details,
see the links below.

For more information, check out the official GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt).
