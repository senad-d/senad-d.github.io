fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder. It's an interactive Unix filter for command-line that can be used with any list; files, command history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, git commits, etc.

![](https://github.com/senad-d/senad-d.github.io/blob/main/_media/images/fzf-preview.png?raw=true){: .shadow }

## Installation

fzf project consists of the following components:

-   `fzf` executable
-   `fzf-tmux` script for launching fzf in a tmux pane
-   Shell extensions
    -   Key bindings (`CTRL-T`, `CTRL-R`, and `ALT-C`) (bash, zsh, fish)
    -   Fuzzy auto-completion (bash, zsh)
-   Vim/Neovim plugin

You can [download fzf executable](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases) alone if you don't need the extra stuff.

### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#using-homebrew)Using Homebrew

You can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (on macOS or Linux) to install fzf.

```shell
brew install fzf

# To install useful key bindings and fuzzy completion:
$(brew --prefix)/opt/fzf/install
```

fzf is also available [via MacPorts](https://github.com/macports/macports-ports/blob/master/sysutils/fzf/Portfile): `sudo port install fzf`

### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#using-git)Using git

Alternatively, you can "git clone" this repository to any directory and run [install](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/install) script.

```shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git ~/.fzf
~/.fzf/install
```

Known issues and limitations on Windows can be found on [the wiki page](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/Windows).

### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#as-vim-plugin)

## Usage

fzf will launch interactive finder, read the list from STDIN, and write the selected item to STDOUT.

```shell
find * -type f | fzf > selected
```

Without STDIN pipe, fzf will use find command to fetch the list of files excluding hidden ones. (You can override the default command with `FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND`)

```shell
vim $(fzf)
```

> _💡 A more robust solution would be to use `xargs` but we've presented the above as it's easier to grasp_
> 
> ```shell
> fzf --print0 | xargs -0 -o vim
> ```

> _💡 fzf also has the ability to turn itself into a different process._
> 
> ```shell
> fzf --bind 'enter:become(vim {})'
> ```
> 
> _See [Turning into a different process](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#turning-into-a-different-process) for more information._

### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#using-the-finder)Using the finder

-   `CTRL-K` / `CTRL-J` (or `CTRL-P` / `CTRL-N`) to move cursor up and down
-   `Enter` key to select the item, `CTRL-C` / `CTRL-G` / `ESC` to exit
-   On multi-select mode (`-m`), `TAB` and `Shift-TAB` to mark multiple items
-   Emacs style key bindings
-   Mouse: scroll, click, double-click; shift-click and shift-scroll on multi-select mode

### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#layout)Layout

fzf by default starts in fullscreen mode, but you can make it start below the cursor with `--height` option.

```shell
vim $(fzf --height 40%)
```

Also, check out `--reverse` and `--layout` options if you prefer "top-down" layout instead of the default "bottom-up" layout.

```shell
vim $(fzf --height 40% --reverse)
```

You can add these options to `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` so that they're applied by default. For example,

```shell
export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS='--height 40% --layout=reverse --border'
```

### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#search-syntax)Search syntax

Unless otherwise specified, fzf starts in "extended-search mode" where you can type in multiple search terms delimited by spaces. e.g. `^music .mp3$ sbtrkt !fire`

| Token | Match type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sbtrkt` | fuzzy-match | Items that match `sbtrkt` |
| `'wild` | exact-match (quoted) | Items that include `wild` |
| `^music` | prefix-exact-match | Items that start with `music` |
| `.mp3$` | suffix-exact-match | Items that end with `.mp3` |
| `!fire` | inverse-exact-match | Items that do not include `fire` |
| `!^music` | inverse-prefix-exact-match | Items that do not start with `music` |
| `!.mp3$` | inverse-suffix-exact-match | Items that do not end with `.mp3` |

If you don't prefer fuzzy matching and do not wish to "quote" every word, start fzf with `-e` or `--exact` option. Note that when `--exact` is set, `'`\-prefix "unquotes" the term.

A single bar character term acts as an OR operator. For example, the following query matches entries that start with `core` and end with either `go`, `rb`, or `py`.

```
^core go$ | rb$ | py$
```

    -   Default command to use when input is tty
    -   e.g. `export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='fd --type f'`
    -   > ⚠️ This variable is not used by shell extensions due to the slight difference in requirements.
        > 
        > (e.g. `CTRL-T` runs `$FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND` instead, `vim **<tab>` runs `_fzf_compgen_path()`, and `cd **<tab>` runs `_fzf_compgen_dir()`)

        > The available options are described later in this document.
        
-   `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`
    -   Default options

### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#options)Options

See the man page (`man fzf`) for the full list of options.
## Fuzzy completion for bash and zsh

### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#files-and-directories)Files and directories

Fuzzy completion for files and directories can be triggered if the word before the cursor ends with the trigger sequence, which is by default `**`.

-   `COMMAND [DIRECTORY/][FUZZY_PATTERN]**<TAB>`

```shell
# Files under the current directory
# - You can select multiple items with TAB key
vim **<TAB>

# Files under parent directory
vim ../**<TAB>

# Files under parent directory that match `fzf`
vim ../fzf**<TAB>

# Files under your home directory
vim ~/**<TAB>


# Directories under current directory (single-selection)
cd **<TAB>

# Directories under ~/github that match `fzf`
cd ~/github/fzf**<TAB>
```

### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#process-ids)Process IDs

Fuzzy completion for PIDs is provided for kill command.

```shell
# Can select multiple processes with <TAB> or <Shift-TAB> keys
kill -9 **<TAB>
```

### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#host-names)Host names

For ssh and telnet commands, fuzzy completion for hostnames is provided. The names are extracted from /etc/hosts and ~/.ssh/config.

```shell
ssh **<TAB>
telnet **<TAB>
```

### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#environment-variables--aliases)Environment variables / Aliases

```shell
unset **<TAB>
export **<TAB>
unalias **<TAB>
```

### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#settings)Settings

```shell
# Use ~~ as the trigger sequence instead of the default **
export FZF_COMPLETION_TRIGGER='~~'

# Options to fzf command
export FZF_COMPLETION_OPTS='--border --info=inline'

# Use fd (https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) instead of the default find
# command for listing path candidates.
# - The first argument to the function ($1) is the base path to start traversal
# - See the source code (completion.{bash,zsh}) for the details.
_fzf_compgen_path() {
  fd --hidden --follow --exclude ".git" . "$1"
}

# Use fd to generate the list for directory completion
_fzf_compgen_dir() {
  fd --type d --hidden --follow --exclude ".git" . "$1"
}

# Advanced customization of fzf options via _fzf_comprun function
# - The first argument to the function is the name of the command.
# - You should make sure to pass the rest of the arguments to fzf.
_fzf_comprun() {
  local command=$1
  shift

  case "$command" in
    cd)           fzf --preview 'tree -C {} | head -200'   "$@" ;;
    export|unset) fzf --preview "eval 'echo \$'{}"         "$@" ;;
    ssh)          fzf --preview 'dig {}'                   "$@" ;;
    *)            fzf --preview 'bat -n --color=always {}' "$@" ;;
  esac
}
```

### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#supported-commands)Supported commands

On bash, fuzzy completion is enabled only for a predefined set of commands (`complete | grep _fzf` to see the list). But you can enable it for other commands as well by using `_fzf_setup_completion` helper function.

```shell
# usage: _fzf_setup_completion path|dir|var|alias|host COMMANDS...
_fzf_setup_completion path ag git kubectl
_fzf_setup_completion dir tree
```

### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#custom-fuzzy-completion)Custom fuzzy completion

_**(Custom completion API is experimental and subject to change)**_

For a command named _"COMMAND"_, define `_fzf_complete_COMMAND` function using `_fzf_complete` helper.

```shell
# Custom fuzzy completion for "doge" command
#   e.g. doge **<TAB>
_fzf_complete_doge() {
  _fzf_complete --multi --reverse --prompt="doge> " -- "$@" < <(
    echo very
    echo wow
    echo such
    echo doge
  )
}
```

-   The arguments before `--` are the options to fzf.
-   After `--`, simply pass the original completion arguments unchanged (`"$@"`).
-   Then, write a set of commands that generates the completion candidates and feed its output to the function using process substitution (`< <(...)`).

zsh will automatically pick up the function using the naming convention but in bash you have to manually associate the function with the command using the `complete` command.

```shell
[ -n "$BASH" ] && complete -F _fzf_complete_doge -o default -o bashdefault doge
```

If you need to post-process the output from fzf, define `_fzf_complete_COMMAND_post` as follows.

```shell
_fzf_complete_foo() {
  _fzf_complete --multi --reverse --header-lines=3 -- "$@" < <(
    ls -al
  )
}

_fzf_complete_foo_post() {
  awk '{print $NF}'
}

[ -n "$BASH" ] && complete -F _fzf_complete_foo -o default -o bashdefault foo
```

## Advanced topics

### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#performance)Performance

fzf is fast. Performance should not be a problem in most use cases. However, you might want to be aware of the options that can affect performance.

-   `--ansi` tells fzf to extract and parse ANSI color codes in the input, and it makes the initial scanning slower. So it's not recommended that you add it to your `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`.
-   `--nth` makes fzf slower because it has to tokenize each line.
-   `--with-nth` makes fzf slower as fzf has to tokenize and reassemble each line.

### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#executing-external-programs)Executing external programs

You can set up key bindings for starting external processes without leaving fzf (`execute`, `execute-silent`).

```shell
# Press F1 to open the file with less without leaving fzf
# Press CTRL-Y to copy the line to clipboard and aborts fzf (requires pbcopy)
fzf --bind 'f1:execute(less -f {}),ctrl-y:execute-silent(echo {} | pbcopy)+abort'
```

See _KEY BINDINGS_ section of the man page for details.

### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#turning-into-a-different-process)Turning into a different process

`become(...)` is similar to `execute(...)`/`execute-silent(...)` described above, but instead of executing the command and coming back to fzf on complete, it turns fzf into a new process for the command.

```shell
fzf --bind 'enter:become(vim {})'
```

Compared to the seemingly equivalent command substitution `vim "$(fzf)"`, this approach has several advantages:

-   Vim will not open an empty file when you terminate fzf with CTRL-C
-   Vim will not open an empty file when you press ENTER on an empty result
-   Can handle multiple selections even when they have whitespaces
    
    ```shell
    fzf --multi --bind 'enter:become(vim {+})'
    ```
    

To be fair, running `fzf --print0 | xargs -0 -o vim` instead of `vim "$(fzf)"` resolves all of the issues mentioned. Nonetheless, `become(...)` still offers additional benefits in different scenarios.

-   You can set up multiple bindings to handle the result in different ways without any wrapping script
    
    ```shell
    fzf --bind 'enter:become(vim {}),ctrl-e:become(emacs {})'
    ```
    
    -   Previously, you would have to use `--expect=ctrl-e` and check the first line of the output of fzf
-   You can easily build the subsequent command using the field index expressions of fzf
    
    ```shell
    # Open the file in Vim and go to the line
    git grep --line-number . |
        fzf --delimiter : --nth 3.. --bind 'enter:become(vim {1} +{2})'
    ```
    

### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#reloading-the-candidate-list)Reloading the candidate list

By binding `reload` action to a key or an event, you can make fzf dynamically reload the candidate list. See [#1750](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/issues/1750) for more details.

#### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#1-update-the-list-of-processes-by-pressing-ctrl-r)1\. Update the list of processes by pressing CTRL-R

```shell
ps -ef |
  fzf --bind 'ctrl-r:reload(ps -ef)' \
      --header 'Press CTRL-R to reload' --header-lines=1 \
      --height=50% --layout=reverse
```

#### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#2-switch-between-sources-by-pressing-ctrl-d-or-ctrl-f)2\. Switch between sources by pressing CTRL-D or CTRL-F

```shell
FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='find . -type f' \
  fzf --bind 'ctrl-d:reload(find . -type d),ctrl-f:reload(eval "$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND")' \
      --height=50% --layout=reverse
```

#### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#3-interactive-ripgrep-integration)3\. Interactive ripgrep integration

The following example uses fzf as the selector interface for ripgrep. We bound `reload` action to `change` event, so every time you type on fzf, the ripgrep process will restart with the updated query string denoted by the placeholder expression `{q}`. Also, note that we used `--disabled` option so that fzf doesn't perform any secondary filtering.

```shell
: | rg_prefix='rg --column --line-number --no-heading --color=always --smart-case' \
    fzf --bind 'start:reload:$rg_prefix ""' \
        --bind 'change:reload:$rg_prefix {q} || true' \
        --bind 'enter:become(vim {1} +{2})' \
        --ansi --disabled \
        --height=50% --layout=reverse
```

If ripgrep doesn't find any matches, it will exit with a non-zero exit status, and fzf will warn you about it. To suppress the warning message, we added `|| true` to the command, so that it always exits with 0.

See ["Using fzf as interactive Ripgrep launcher"](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/ADVANCED.md#using-fzf-as-interactive-ripgrep-launcher) for more sophisticated examples.

### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#preview-window)Preview window

When the `--preview` option is set, fzf automatically starts an external process with the current line as the argument and shows the result in the split window. Your `$SHELL` is used to execute the command with `$SHELL -c COMMAND`. The window can be scrolled using the mouse or custom key bindings.

```shell
# {} is replaced with the single-quoted string of the focused line
fzf --preview 'cat {}'
```

Preview window supports ANSI colors, so you can use any program that syntax-highlights the content of a file, such as [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) or [Highlight](http://www.andre-simon.de/doku/highlight/en/highlight.php):

```shell
fzf --preview 'bat --color=always {}' --preview-window '~3'
```

You can customize the size, position, and border of the preview window using `--preview-window` option, and the foreground and background color of it with `--color` option. For example,

```shell
fzf --height 40% --layout reverse --info inline --border \
    --preview 'file {}' --preview-window up,1,border-horizontal \
    --bind 'ctrl-/:change-preview-window(50%|hidden|)' \
    --color 'fg:#bbccdd,fg+:#ddeeff,bg:#334455,preview-bg:#223344,border:#778899'
```

See the man page (`man fzf`) for the full list of options.

More advanced examples can be found [here](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/ADVANCED.md).

___

Since fzf is a general-purpose text filter rather than a file finder, **it is not a good idea to add `--preview` option to your `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`**.

```shell
# *********************
# ** DO NOT DO THIS! **
# *********************
export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS='--preview "bat --style=numbers --color=always --line-range :500 {}"'

# bat doesn't work with any input other than the list of files
ps -ef | fzf
seq 100 | fzf
history | fzf
```

## [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#tips)Tips

### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#respecting-gitignore)Respecting `.gitignore`

You can use [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), or [the silver searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) instead of the default find command to traverse the file system while respecting `.gitignore`.

```shell
# Feed the output of fd into fzf
fd --type f --strip-cwd-prefix | fzf

# Setting fd as the default source for fzf
export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='fd --type f --strip-cwd-prefix'

# Now fzf (w/o pipe) will use fd instead of find
fzf

# To apply the command to CTRL-T as well
export FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND="$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND"
```

If you want the command to follow symbolic links and don't want it to exclude hidden files, use the following command:

```shell
export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='fd --type f --strip-cwd-prefix --hidden --follow --exclude .git'
```

### [](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation#fish-shell)Fish shell

`CTRL-T` key binding of fish, unlike those of bash and zsh, will use the last token on the command-line as the root directory for the recursive search. For instance, hitting `CTRL-T` at the end of the following command-line

```shell
ls /var/
```

will list all files and directories under `/var/`.

When using a custom `FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND`, use the unexpanded `$dir` variable to make use of this feature. `$dir` defaults to `.` when the last token is not a valid directory. Example:

```shell
set -g FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND "command find -L \$dir -type f 2> /dev/null | sed '1d; s#^\./##'"
```
