>Thank you for visiting. Together, let's unlock the full potential of DevOps and propel you towards continuous success.

## Enhancing Collaboration
My mission is to empower individuals by providing comprehensive and streamlined DevOps documentation. In today's fast-paced and ever-evolving technology landscape, DevOps has emerged as a game-changing methodology. It brings together the realms of development and operations, fostering collaboration, efficiency, and agility throughout the software development lifecycle. However, harnessing the true potential of DevOps requires more than just implementing the right tools and processes—it demands effective documentation practices that enable seamless knowledge sharing and enhance cross-functional collaboration.
Whether you are embarking on your DevOps journey or seeking to optimize your existing practices, my documentation offer a comprehensive approach. 


## About me
I am a dedicated and passionate DevOps Engineer with a profound interest in the world of computers. Despite pursuing an education and career in chemistry and later in the oil industry, I never ceased to explore the fascinating realm of information technology, which has always been my true passion. Alongside my professional endeavors, I also invested my time and energy into karate, achieving the role of a coach for young athletes.

Throughout this journey, I consistently made room for self-education in the field of computer science. With the invaluable assistance of my friend and current colleague, Mario, I successfully navigated through the demands of work and family responsibilities, gradually mastering the fundamental principles of DevOps. I further enriched my knowledge by attending online academies, obtaining certification as an AWS Solution Architect.

To enhance my expertise, I established a home lab environment, where I extensively explored Linux, along with various tools such as Docker, Grafana, Nginx, Portainer, Plausible, and many others. Continuously expanding my knowledge base, I confidently tackled complex DevOps concepts. Eventually, I reached a point where I was confident in my abilities to tackle any task encountered in the DevOps domain.

Recognizing the need for a career transition from the oil industry to IT, I sought new opportunities and joined Typeqast (now Valcon), an outstanding company in Croatia. Here, I currently work and thoroughly enjoy each day of my job. Every task presented to me serves as a fresh puzzle that I eagerly strive to solve, always seeking to acquire new insights and knowledge.

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my mentor, ***Mario Runtić***, whose guidance and support have been instrumental in my professional growth.
